# **Final Project**: Inclusive America
501 (c) 3 looking to shed light on lack of representation within the U.S. government.

# **Project Summary** 

I want my audience to know that the White House has the power to higher approximately 9,000 people and they continiously choose to be exclusionary to women, minorities, veterans, people with disabilities, etc. The White House Presidential Personel Office is responsible for vetting and keeping a large pool of quality candidates for the President, as well as the Secretary if they need to fill a vacancy.  We can become better informed and voice our concerns to our elected officials in order to have the office adopt a more inclusionary hiring process. 

## **Audience**

Primary: Media. In order to highlight issue of under underrepresentation of so many groups of people living in the United States to the masses. Create a sense of urgency 

Secondary: Presidential Personel Office. Feel pressure from the people (by way of the media) to act and put forward a more diverse pool of candidates. 

## **Goals**

Increase diversity within government to represent the diversity of the 327 million people who reside in the United States

# **Sketches/Visualization Types**:

The approach I wish to take is to use visualizations that are emotive. I'm acting from the perspective of a data journalist so the graphic should be simple, yet informative and will drive a point home. By highliting outrageous trends or statistics, we can grab the audience with a good hook and then convey the severity and importance of pressuring government to employ individuals representative of the entire nation.

Example which packs a punch: More Secretaries of Education named 'John' than Female Secretaries *Total*

Stacked Bar Chart or Stacked 100% Bar Chart -- make up of employees by age or gender
