# **About Me**:

Hey! My name is Brosha--some people call me B. I'm currently enrolled in the MPM program here at Heinz and I will hopefully be graduating in December. I've lived in Pgh for most of my life and currently reside on the North Side. My pronouns are she/her. 

# **What I Hope to Learn**: 

What I'm hoping to get out of this course is a much better understanding of how to present data in a clean way. I'm not a very creative person, or really a data person, but I hope to get a baseline sense of how to use different methods to convey dense information in a way that everyone can understand. This is a skill I would be able to apply to my work. Conveying information regarding budgets, trends, observations gathered from census tract information, etc. is essential in conveying a message which may result in operation/policy changeâ€”something I try to achieve at work. I'm currently employed full-time so I do not have immediate plans after graduation, but I hope to start using the these skills to improve my work.
