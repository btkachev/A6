# **About Me**:

Hey! My name is Brosha--some people call me B. I'm currently enrolled in the MPM program here at Heinz and I will hopefully be graduating in December. I've lived in Pgh for most of my life and currently reside on the North Side. My pronouns are she/her. 

# **What I Hope to Learn**: 

What I'm hoping to get out of this course is a much better understanding of how to present data in a clean way. I'm not a very creative person, or really a data person, but I hope to get a baseline sense of how to use different methods to convey dense information in a way that everyone can understand. This is a skill I would be able to apply to my work. Conveying information regarding budgets, trends, observations gathered from census tract information, etc. is essential in conveying a message which may result in operation/policy change—something I try to achieve at work. I'm currently employed full-time so I do not have immediate plans after graduation, but I hope to start using the these skills to improve my work.

OIG: DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention of Children and Adults in the Rio Grande Valley

When creating visuals from the perspective of the data journalist, I first sought to define my target audience and publication type. I created the content for a publication like TIME magazine, one that is widely read by the general public and which does not have a leaner audience like Washington Post, NYT, Economist, etc. The broad audience forces me to work harder in order to catch the eye. Furthermore, readers may be individuals who lack interest in politics.  Knowing that a) I was trying to reach a wide audience and b) that I needed/wanted to elicit an emotional response I explored data sets and visualization options which serve well to demonstrate a stark comparison or simplify the message in order to be effective. 

I chose to visualize data found on page 3 of the report—statistics related to the number of detainees who had been held over 72 hrs, as well as more than 10 days. The numbers are impactful in that they are simple and straightforward ratios that represent an incredibly complex problem of overcrowding on a large scale. I chose to use a pictorial visualization for two reasons. First, because it achieves the goal of humanizing the numbers by literally representing them in a human form. This assists in eliciting an emotional response. Second, because I was trying to highlight a subset of a whole in a way that would grab the attention of the audience the pictorial was able to do that in a nontraditional representation with minimal color and element use. The graphic is able to grab attention, plainly demonstrate the data, as well as humanize a statistic.
