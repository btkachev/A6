# **Final Project**: Inclusive America
501 (c) 3 looking to shed light on lack of representation within the U.S. government.

# **Project Summary** 

I want my audience to know that the White House has the power to higher approximately 9,000 people and they continiously choose to be exclusionary to women, minorities, veterans, people with disabilities, etc. The White House Presidential Personel Office is responsible for vetting and keeping a large pool of quality candidates for the President, as well as the Secretary if they need to fill a vacancy.  We can become better informed and voice our concerns to our elected officials in order to have the office adopt a more inclusionary hiring process. 

## **Audience**

Primary: Media. In order to highlight issue of under underrepresentation of so many groups of people living in the United States to the masses. Create a sense of urgency 

Secondary: Presidential Personel Office. Feel pressure from the people (by way of the media) to act and put forward a more diverse pool of candidates. 

## **Goals**

Increase diversity within government to represent the diversity of the 327 million people who reside in the United States

# **Sketches/Visualization Types**:

The approach I wish to take is to use visualizations that are emotive. I'm acting from the perspective of a data journalist so the graphic should be simple, yet informative and will drive a point home. By highliting outrageous trends or statistics, we can grab the audience with a good hook and then convey the severity and importance of pressuring government to employ individuals representative of the entire nation.

Example which packs a punch: More Secretaries of Education named 'John' than Female Secretaries *Total*

## *Visualization types to explore...*

Demonstrating Distribution 
Scatter plot-- dot representing employees of both genders within the context of two categories: age and rank within department
Stacked Bar Chart or Stacked 100% Bar Chart -- make up of employees by age or gender
Meaningful Pictograph--must convey complex analysis 


# **Data**

Stored on salesforce but gathered from WH Personel Office.

# **Part II**

## Storyboard

This section provides a more visual outline of the story I hope to tell. As mentioned in Part I, I'll start by introducing the audience to the role of WH Office of Personel within the context of presidential appointment powers. Visualizations and text demonstrate breakdown of gender among appointees. Audience should make conclusions and inferences based on data presented. Goal is for individuals who produce content to use the visualizatons in their work.

Personas: During the audience analysis portion of Part I, I spent some time discussing the fact that these visualizations are geared toward journalists. This was based on my conversation with an individual associated with the organization. In my mind, the persona is an individual between 30-60 (working age), with some higher education, interest in government, accountability, equity. Essentially, I modeled this persona on journalists with whom I am familiar and whose work I enjoy. 




## User research protocol

Audience | Description
--- | --- 
Target Audience 1| Journalists, mass media content creators in need of accompanying data vizualizations. They are individuals looking for visualization that can convey their message in a clear/concise manner|
Target Audience 2| Consumers of mass media content, specifically individuals interested in equity, government representation, preservation of democratic process. Looking to give them new insight via data viz|
Sample| Sample was limited to three individuals. The first, a journalist working in Western PA covering topics ranging from government proceedings to fracking impacts on community and environment. Second individual is one currently working in the nonprofit field, specializing in finance. Individual expressed interest in the interaction of private and public sectors--which is tangentially related to my topic of interest. The 3rd individual in the sample audience works in the biomedical field. All 3 are males in their mid to late 30s. 

Research goals/Questions

Goal | Question
--- | ---   
Relevance of Content| Are these relevant to the equity and representation conversation? Is this useful to effectively critique government? Do these statistics matter to you?
Clarity| Do you have any questions regarding the data being presented? 
Emotiveness| Did the content of the visualized statistics jump out at you? Was this information new to you? 
Improvement| Was something confusing to you? How could the visualizations be improved/more effective? What kind of visualization method work best for you? 
Download/use| Would you use this in your article? 

Method of interview

1. Informal. Approximately 5 to 10 min interview
2. One interview over email/phone and two interviews face-to-face. 
3. Interviewee shown drawn layout/ digital visualizatons on my laptop and in one case, email.
4. I ask several questions and write down their main points as they are said.

## Interview Script

*Hey! Thanks for taking the time to look at my website and graphic designs and ideas. This content is being created for Inclusive America, a 501 (c) 3 organization whose mission is to highlight the lack of representation within the presidentially appointed pool of employees within the White House. More specifically, I'm examining the diversity of the presidentially appointed WH employees in the Department of Education during the last two presidencies, as well as the current. 

*I'm going to show you messages and accompanying graphics and then ask you a few questions. The questions I'd like you to answer are: 1. Do these statistics matter to you? Why? 2. Are these useful in the equity and representation conversation? 3. Do you have any questions regarding the data being presented?  4. Did the content of the visualized statistics jump out at you? 5. Would you use this in your article? Or any of your work? 

*Thanks for taking the time to give me feedback! I hope this conversation makes you think about the importance of representation in government and how we're not yet there. 

## Feedback

Question | Feedback 
--- | --- |
Do these statistics matter to you? Why? | **Journalist**: Potentially. I would use these if I was working on a 'fact checking' article. Like if a candidate said they favor gender equity, or tout a record of some sort, I'd either examine or use these to make a point. **Nonprofit employee**: They aren't relevant to my work. They are interesting though--make me think of people in my office. **Civil servant**: Yeah. There are lots of conversations about a lack of representation in government. 
Are these useful in the equity and representation conversation? | **Journalist**: Sure. Again, I'd use them to point out whether or not a candidate has a record to back up their claims during election time or other times. **Nonprofit employee**: Yeah. 
Do you have any questions regarding the data being presented? | **Journalist**: How did you get it? **Nonprofit employee**: How involved is the president in all the appointments? **Government**: How's the data gathered?
Did the content of the visualized statistics jump out at you? | **Journalist**: Not exactly. I'm familiar with employment disparity. **Nonprofit employee**: I guess. Maybe show more trends. **Gov**: It was interesting. 
Would you use this in your work? | **Journalist**: Potentially. Maybe find other visualizations which take the information and show a trend over time and maybe compare it to other trends. **Nonprofit employee**: I don't really make content but maybe I'd mention the 'John' thing. **Gov**: I would possibly use it if I needed to write up a whitepaper in support of some legislation. 

## Revision work

I looked to see if I could find chart types that were intersting, or perhaps more creative than I would usually go for. Added information re: collection and background to try to raise trust.

Used blue to indicate additions I'm adding to web content on shorthand. Include more information on data source and compare administrations. Need to explore more creative visualization options. Pic/graph combinations.
